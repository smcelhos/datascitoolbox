#Dojo Bullet Graph

A store enabled version of the BulletGraph.  Abstracts any data manipulation behind a store providing a familiar API.  A few additional modifications were made so as to allow the widget to self normalize data by just setting dataProperty attributes.  A dijit widget, so some nice benefits there as well, such as declarative instantiation, getters/setters, a lifecycle etc.
